Welcome to the DNS Trust code repository!
DNS Trust is a service for Domain Name Registrars & Registries developed in consultation with a wide group of stakeholders interesting in improving Domain Name System security.
This repository will host the core development code for the DNS Trust database and functions.  It will also offer a number of Open Source projects to enable our partners and stakeholders to use and integrate into their own system.
Launched in Spring 2021 the service aims to be fully operational for all customers by the end of 2022.
We will be inviting others to participate in beta projects from time to time.  Please check back periodically for updates.
